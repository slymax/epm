# Exodus Profile Manager

EPM allows you to use multiple Exodus wallets on the same computer.

### Getting Started

run `npm install -g @slymax/epm` to install epm.

### Commands

**`epm use [profile name]`** switches to a new or existing profile.

If you've been using Exodus without epm, your existing configuration will be moved to the `backup` profile when you're switching profiles for the first time.

**`epm list`** lists all available profiles.

**`epm delete [profile name]`** deletes a profile.

**`epm rename [old profile name] [new profile name]`** renames a profile.
